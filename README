This is software to control LEDs over USB, like my modified IKEA DIODER.

dioder_lib.py:

Routines to list, connect to and send message to USB hid device.

dioder_cli.py:

Send commands to HID-device over USB.

dioder_pulse.py:

Audio visualizer based on Ian Halpern's Impulse.
It requires a copy/link of impulse.so and libimpulse.so to work.

dioder_gtk.py:

Set LED levels from a GTK interface.


Permissions to device:
Depending on your system you might not be able access the HID device as a regular user.
To solve that you can use udev to set different permissions for the devices you want.
