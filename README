This is software to control LEDs over USB, like my modified IKEA DIODER.

dioder_lib.py:

Routines to list, connect to and send message to USB hid device.

dioder_cli.py:

Send commands to HID-device over USB.

dioder_pulse.py:

Audio visualizer based on Ian Halpern's Impulse.
It requires a copy/link of impulse.so and libimpulse.so to work.
